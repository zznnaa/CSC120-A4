- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    I have to make getters and setters for my code, but otherwise it really doesn't affect my program that much to encapsulate things instead of making everything public.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Worked - starting and not being scared to start!
    Didn't Work - not commenting my code when I actually write it so having to do that later *crying emoji*
    Advice - COMMENT YOUR CODE AS YOU WRITE SERIOUSLY PAST ME WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
